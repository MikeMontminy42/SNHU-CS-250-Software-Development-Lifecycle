How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this:

   Interpreting user needs and translating them into a program requires me to understand the "why" behind each requested feature. User stories are helpful as they break down user needs into specific items from the perspective of the end-user, detailing what the end goal is and why  this is the end goal. This helps keep the focus solely on the user's goals and ensures that every feature has a definitive purpose and isn't there for no reason.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work:

   When approaching program development,an Agile methodology like Scrum can help to guide the development process. Agile’s iterative cycles help to keep projects flexible and focused on continuous improvement, which is ideal for responding to any new features or changes needed. As I develop programs in the future, incorporating Agile elements such as sprint planning and retrospectives can help me stay highly adaptable. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development:

   Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing code. It involves efficient collabororation, listening to other perspectives, and contributing to the team goals. In Agile, this could be anything from actively participating in morning discussion meetings, sharing regular updates, to helping resolve issues for others.
